# How to apply the texture pack!:

1. Launch Geometry Dash and head to Options then Graphics. Then set the graphics quality to High. (I only edited UHD files)
2. Exit Geometry Dash, and head to your Steam library.
3. Right click Geometry Dash on your Steam library then Manage > Browse Local Files.
4. Backup your resources folder somewhere so you don't lose the original files. (please.)
5. Drag contents of "Resources" into the "Resources" folder in your local files in your GD Directory.
6. Open the game and see if it works, **you'll know when it works.**

That easy :p
