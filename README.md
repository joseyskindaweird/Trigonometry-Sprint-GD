# Trigonometry Sprint
# A texture pack for Geometry Dash 2.2 that includes the most random images, memes, and audio from my friends.



How to install:

Launch Geometry Dash and head to Options then Graphics. Then set the graphics quality to High. (I only edited UHD files)
Exit Geometry Dash, and head to your Steam library.
Right Click Geometry Dash on your Steam library then Manage > Browse Local Files.
Backup your resources folder somewhere so you don't lose the original files. (please.)
Drag contents of "Resources" into the "Resources" folder in your local files in your GD Directory.
Replace the files in the destination and make sure you don't delete CCLocalLevels.dat!!
Open the game and see if it works, **you'll know when it works.**
